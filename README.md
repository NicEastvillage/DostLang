Dost is a programming language interpreted by a Discord bot. It has very limited functionality and use-cases.

The Discord bot will interpret the given code and replay with the console output when done interpreting as seen the image below.

Dost was developed as an exercise to understand programming languages, compilers and interpreters... and Discord bots.
